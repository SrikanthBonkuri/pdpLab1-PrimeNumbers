Create a Java application that requests a user to enter how many prime numbers to generate, the system generates the prime numbers and totals their value. The system will output the prime numbers and their sum total. 

 

Test your application by entering 5 as the number of prime numbers to generate 
The result should be 
Numbers generated: 1,2,3,5,7
Sum of the numbers: 18. 

 

Test the solution with further examples (You should include a "test" directory to do this!).
